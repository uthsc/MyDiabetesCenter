        <p>The Diabetes Wellness and Prevention Coalition is a patient, provider, and research partnership started in 2009 by Dr. Michael Ugwueke, then CEO of Methodist South Hospital, to improve diabetes care by emphasizing "prevention through proactive disease management…shift[ing] the treatment paradigm to the outpatient arena…thus…reducing the incidence and severity of the complications experienced by the patient, leading to an increase in quality of life." The organization and key partners in the Coalition are shown below:</p>

        <p>Since then, patients, caregivers, community members, and providers have worked together in Whitehaven, Tennessee to galvanize efforts to address and reverse the diabetes epidemic. Since 2009 the Coalition has sought to develop both outpatient physical space devoted to a comprehensive Diabetes Wellness and Prevention Center on the Methodist South Hospital campus and the patient, provider, and research collaboration necessary to transform diabetes care in Whitehaven from a focus on reactive, rescue care to a focus that is truly patient-centered and mobilizes and engages the entire community.</p>
