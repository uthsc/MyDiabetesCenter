        <h2>Join us in the effort to improve care in the Mid-South!</h2>
        <p>The Diabetes Wellness and Prevention Coalition (DWPC) in collaboration with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center operates the <i>DWPC Registry</i> to track processes and outcomes of care and improve care for people living with diabetes or at risk for diabetes in the Mid-South. The <i>DWPC Registry</i> fully qualifies as a Specialized Registry for the purposes of achieving meaningful use of electronic health records. We have begun accepting data as a specialized registry and will be using the data to improve population health outcomes.  The <i>DWPC Registry</i> also undergirds our practice improvement work through the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded <i>Management Of Diabetes in Everyday Life (MODEL) Program</i>. We also provide practice feedback of quarterly practice improvement reports to participating providers.</p>

        <p>We are able to receive electronic data generated from certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT) through appropriate secure mechanisms. The <i>DWPC Registry</i> has a registration of intent process that takes clinics and other providers through test and validation and a process to move into production. We provide participating providers with appropriate documentation in order to begin this process and we notify them by email on a regular basis of the status of their feeds to the registry and whether they are currently meeting our criteria for "Active Engagement".</p>
