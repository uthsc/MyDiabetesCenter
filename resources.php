                <h2 id="physical-activity">Physical Activity</h2>

                <p>Physical activity is another important part of your diabetes management plan. When you exercise, your muscles use sugar (glucose) for energy. Regular physical activity also helps your body use insulin more efficiently.</p>

                <p>These factors work together to lower your blood sugar level. The more strenuous your workout, the longer the effect lasts. But even light activities--such as housework, gardening or being on your feet for extended periods--can improve your blood sugar level.</p>

                <p>What to do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talk to your doctor about exercise plan.</li>
                    <li>Keep an exercise schedule.</li>

                <p>Healthy eating is a cornerstone of health living--with or without diabetes. But if you diabetes, you need to know how foods affect your blood sugar levels. It’s not only the type of food you eat but also how you eat and the combinations of food types you eat.</p>
